This is a simple web app displaying the collegues at tretton37. The app is build with create-react-app using typescript and css-modules. To use this app, clone the repo and add a .env with the following variables:

REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT
and

then start the app locally by:

npm ci
npm start

or simply deploy the app to a hosting provider like Netlify. Don't forget to supply the env. variables.

### Typescript

### Unit tests
Some small tests are written, although it is not my strongest side. This is an area where id like to improve, alot.

## Reason for features
Most of the features are chosen because i have experience with it and know somewhat how to do it. Areas that i didn't focus on was on accesabilty (colorblindness and screen reader) since i havn't used these features in older projects and though it might be better to do show my more experieced qualities in this assignment.
